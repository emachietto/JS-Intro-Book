// what is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

// exception handling is providing specific actions to be taken in the case of an error
// it allows flexibility in the face of unpredictable input

// it solves the premature termination of programs encountering an error
// it allows unique/perhaps clearer exceptions to be thrown for specific problems
